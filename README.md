# Stereo Image Matching and Disparity Map Visualization

## Introduction
This MATLAB project focuses on stereo image matching using normalized cross-correlation to create a disparity map, emphasizing the computational approach without built-in functions for educational purposes.

## Features
- **Image Matching**: Implements area-based matching using normalized cross-correlation for stereo image pairs.
- **Disparity Map Creation**: Generates disparity maps to represent depth information based on image pair similarities.
- **Optimization**: Identifies optimal parameters for window size and search range for accurate disparity estimation.

## Technologies
- **MATLAB**: Utilized for all computations, image processing, and visualization steps.
